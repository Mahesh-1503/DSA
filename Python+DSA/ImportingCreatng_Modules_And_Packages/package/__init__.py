'''
__init__.py is a special Python file that indicates that the directory it is in should be treated as a package. It can be empty, or it can contain initialization code for the package.
This file is executed when the package is imported, allowing you to set up package-level variables or import submodules.
This file can also define the public API of the package by specifying which modules or functions should be accessible when the package is imported.
For example, you can import specific functions or classes from submodules to make them available at the package level.
This allows users to import them directly from the package without needing to know the internal structure of the package.
